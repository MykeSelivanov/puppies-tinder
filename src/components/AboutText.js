            <p className="AboutTextContent1">It's like Tinder, but with Dogs!</p>
            <p className="AboutTextContent2">The sad eyes searching for the loving heart, for a friend and companion;
            the sad stories and a struggle for life… We say: “No, no more sadness” with a dog adoption app Puppies-Tinder
            that helps dogs find forever homes.</p>
            <p className="AboutTextContent3">Puppies-Tinder promotes social responsibility, seeks to create an emotionally
            healthier society and is acting for the animals’ good.</p>
            <p className="AboutTextContent4">We created Puppies-Tinder in response to a number: 2.5 million.<br></br>
            That’s how many pets are surrendered to shelters each year because their owners can’t keep them.
            Shelters don’t have the money or room to care for them. <br></br>
            They already have 5 million strays and abused animals to take in each year.
            And so, millions are euthanized.
            We are determined that things don’t have to be this way.<br></br>
             Not in our 21st century, web-connected world. So we created Puppies-Tinder, an online community where people who can’t keep their pets connect directly with people who want to adopt a pet.<br></br>
            Together, we’ll keep dogs and cats from ever seeing the inside of a shelter, so they can love and be loved in new homes.
            Saving lives. Unburdening shelters. Creating community to make a difference. That’s our mission.<br></br>
             That’s what we want you to know about us.
